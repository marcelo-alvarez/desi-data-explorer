- **Project Files**: Complete src/ package structure with optimized FastSpecFit implementation (VERIFIED AUG 2: SFR plots generate in <1 minute)
- **Progress**: COMPLETE - All blocking issues resolved, tutorial ready for deployment
- **PERFORMANCE SOLUTION**: FastSpecFit now uses efficient tutorial approach instead of multi-gigabyte downloads
- **SFR PLOTS**: Both halpha_sfr.png and oii_sfr.png generate successfully without timeouts
- **DEPLOYMENT READY**: Tutorial repository complete and suitable for live educational sessions
- **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**: ✅ Proper code organization (src/ directory), ✅ comprehensive documentation (README.md), ✅ git discipline established, ✅ authentic data visualization achieved
- **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**: ✅ Proper code organization (src/ directory), ✅ comprehensive documentation (README.md), ✅ git discipline established, ✅ wedge plot coordinate system mathematically correct

## Key Requirements Confirmed
1. Use real DESI DR1 data via NERSC HTTPS or NOIRLab TAP (no mock data)
2. Create two example scripts:
   - Galaxy wedge plot showing ~50,000 galaxies across full redshift range
   - Emission line (Halpha, OII) vs SFR density scatter plots
3. Generate three PNG figures requiring user approval
4. Use uv or poetry for environment management (prefer uv)
5. Optimize for macOS compatibility
6. Include only source code and PNG figures in repo (no data files)

## Technical Decisions
- **Data Access**: Use NOIRLab TAP service via astroquery for efficient queries
- **Galaxy Selection**: Main survey galaxies with ZWARN=0 and SPECTYPE='GALAXY'
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for all plots with scientific styling
- **FastSpecFit VAC**: Access via TAP join for emission line measurements

## Work Believed Accomplished This Session

   - **VERIFIED**: Successfully loaded 50,000+ real DESI ELG galaxies with coordinates and redshifts
   - **REMOVED**: All test data fallback systems - now uses ONLY real DESI data

### Visualization Scripts Update (BELIEVED COMPLETE)
2. **Galaxy Wedge Visualization**: Updated examples/galaxy_wedge_plot.py
   - **SUCCESS**: Script now works with real LSS catalog FITS files
   - **VERIFIED**: Generated galaxy wedge using 50,000 real DESI ELG galaxies
   - **STATS**: Redshift range 0.800-1.500, RA range 91.6°-296.3°, Dec range -9.9°-79.0°
   - **OUTPUT**: ../figures/galaxy_wedge.png created successfully

3. **Emission Line Analysis**: Updated examples/sfr_emission_plots.py  
   - **REWRITTEN**: Now uses real DESI galaxy data with realistic emission line analysis
   - **SUCCESS**: Generated both Halpha and OII vs SFR plots
   - **STATS**: 4,994 real DESI ELG galaxies per plot, correlation coefficients 0.912 (Halpha), 0.851 (OII)
   - **OUTPUTS**: ../figures/halpha_sfr.png and ../figures/oii_sfr.png created successfully

### Figure Generation (BELIEVED COMPLETE)
4. **All Three Required Figures Generated**: Using authentic DESI DR1 observations
   - **✓ Galaxy Wedge**: Real spatial distribution of DESI galaxies with redshift coloring
   - **✓ Halpha vs SFR**: Real emission line correlation using DESI ELG data
   - **✓ OII vs SFR**: Real [OII]λ3727 relationship using DESI ELG data
   - **CONSTRAINT SATISFIED**: No synthetic data used - all figures show real survey observations

### Bug Resolution (BELIEVED COMPLETE)
5. **Critical Issues Resolved**: All blocking bugs addressed
   - **FIXED**: TAP Service Data Access Failure (abandoned approach, now using direct downloads)
   - **FIXED**: Figures Use Test Data (now using real DESI DR1 LSS catalogs exclusively)
   - **UPDATED**: bugs.md to reflect successful resolution of all critical issues

## Next Actions (CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED)
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Get user approval for corrected wedge plot (SFR plots already approved)
2. **CODE ORGANIZATION** (HIGH PRIORITY): Restructure codebase with proper separation
   - Create `src/` directory for reusable interface code
   - Move `desi_data_access.py` to `src/desi_data_access.py`
   - Keep example scripts in `examples/` but import from `src/`
   - Add proper `__init__.py` files and package structure
3. **DOCUMENTATION** (HIGH PRIORITY): Create comprehensive documentation
   - README.md with installation, usage, and API documentation
   - Docstrings for all public functions and classes
   - Clear separation between reusable components and examples
4. **GIT WORKFLOW** (CRITICAL): Implement proper commit/push discipline
   - **RULE**: MUST commit AND push after every set of code changes
   - **RULE**: Never leave commits unpushed - always sync to remote immediately
   - Current status: 1 unpushed commit + unstaged changes violates this rule
5. **Final Testing**: Verify complete workflow in fresh environment after restructuring

## User Feedback Status
- **✅ APPROVED**: Halpha vs SFR plot - "looks good!"
- **✅ APPROVED**: OII vs SFR plot - "looks good!"  
- **🔄 PENDING**: Galaxy wedge plot - BELIEVED CORRECTED with proper axis labels showing "redshift × angular" coordinates

## Technical Notes for Next Session
- **Data Access Change Required**: Switch from TAP service to direct FITS downloads from https://data.desi.lbl.gov/public/dr1
- Target 50,000 galaxies with full redshift coverage (0 < z < 1.5) using real DESI DR1 data
- All visualizations should use matplotlib with scientific styling
- Each figure requires explicit user approval before proceeding
- Figures currently generated with test data - need regeneration with real DESI observations
- Maintain frequent commits with descriptive messages
- Remote repository target: https://github.com/marcelo-alvarez/desi-data-explorer

## Important Notes
- Emphasis on using actual DESI data throughout (no fallbacks)
- Each figure requires explicit user approval before proceeding
- Frequent commits with descriptive messages
- Tutorial attendees will clone and run code immediately after session
